# Email Safety Implementation Summary

## Critical Business Requirement Addressed
**Problem**: User reported that sending failed/error summaries via email would cause "重大なクレーム" (major customer complaints).

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive email safety mechanism that prevents sending emails when LLM summary generation fails or contains errors.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced LLM Summarizer (`src/utils/llm_summarizer.py`)

**Key Changes**:
- **Strict error detection**: Defaults to `llm_error_detected = True` for safety-first approach
- **Error indicator scanning**: Automatically detects error indicators like "LocalLLM処理エラー", "簡易要約", "フォールバック", "エラー"
- **Explicit email safety flag**: Added `email_safe` flag that explicitly marks summaries as safe for email delivery
- **Processing status tracking**: Clear distinction between "Failed" and "Success" processing states

**Critical Safety Logic**:
```python
# Default to error state for safety
llm_error_detected = True
llm_error_message = "Default error state"

# Only mark as success if LLM actually worked without any fallback
if self.localllm_available and not any(indicator in summary_result for indicator in error_indicators):
    llm_error_detected = False
    llm_error_message = "LLM processing successful"

# Explicit email safety flag
"email_safe": not llm_error_detected
```

### 2. Enhanced Main Processing (`src/main.py`)

**Key Changes**:
- **Strict validation**: Email sending requires BOTH `llm_error_detected=False` AND `email_safe=True`
- **Safety-first defaults**: Defaults to blocking email unless explicitly marked safe
- **Comprehensive logging**: Clear logging of why emails are blocked
- **Customer protection**: Explicit messaging about preventing customer complaints

**Critical Email Safety Check**:
```python
# CRITICAL: Use explicit email_safe flag to prevent customer complaints
summary_info = llm_summary.get('summary_info', {})
llm_error_detected = summary_info.get('llm_error_detected', True)  # Default to error for safety
email_safe = summary_info.get('email_safe', False)  # Explicit email safety flag

# STRICT validation for email sending safety
if (llm_summary and 
    llm_summary.get('processing_status') == 'Success' and
    llm_summary.get('summary') and
    len(llm_summary.get('summary', '')) > 50 and
    not llm_error_detected and
    email_safe):  # CRITICAL: Must be explicitly marked as email safe
```

### 3. Email Sending Protection

**Email is BLOCKED when**:
- `llm_error_detected = True` (any LLM processing error)
- `email_safe = False` (not explicitly marked as safe)
- Summary contains error indicators
- Processing status is "Failed"
- Summary is too short (< 50 characters)

**Email is ALLOWED only when**:
- `llm_error_detected = False` (no LLM errors)
- `email_safe = True` (explicitly marked as safe)
- Processing status is "Success"
- Summary has sufficient content (> 50 characters)
- No error indicators detected

## Safety Verification

Created `test_email_safety.py` that validates:
- ✅ Emails blocked when LLM errors detected
- ✅ Emails blocked when not marked as email safe
- ✅ Emails blocked for fallback summaries
- ✅ Emails only sent for successful LLM processing

## Logging Messages

**When email is blocked**:
```
❌ LLM error detected: LLM libraries not available - CRITICAL: Do not send email
❌ Summary not marked as EMAIL SAFE - may contain errors or fallback content
🚫 Email sending will be CANCELLED to prevent customer complaints
🚫 EMAIL SENDING CANCELLED - Summary failed safety validation
🚫 This prevents sending incomplete/error information that could cause customer complaints
🚫 Recipients will NOT receive potentially problematic content
```

**When email is allowed**:
```
✅ LocalLLM summary generated successfully and marked as EMAIL SAFE
📧 Email notification sending - Summary is SAFE and verified
```

## Customer Protection Achieved

1. **Zero tolerance for error content**: No emails sent with error indicators
2. **Safety-first approach**: Defaults to blocking unless explicitly safe
3. **Comprehensive validation**: Multiple layers of safety checks
4. **Clear audit trail**: Detailed logging of safety decisions
5. **Business continuity**: Protects customer relationships from problematic content

## Technical Benefits

- **Fail-safe design**: System fails safely by blocking emails rather than sending problematic content
- **Explicit safety marking**: Clear distinction between working summaries and fallback content
- **Comprehensive error detection**: Catches multiple types of LLM failures
- **Maintainable code**: Clear separation of safety logic and business logic
- **Testable implementation**: Safety mechanism can be independently verified

This implementation ensures that the InfoGetter system will **never send emails containing failed, error, or fallback summaries**, protecting the business from customer complaints while maintaining system reliability.
