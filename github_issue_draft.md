# GitHub Issue Draft for LocalLLM Repository

## Issue Title
🐛 pip install fails - Package installation not supported for external integration

## Issue Description

### 📋 Problem Summary
The LocalLLM repository cannot be installed via `pip install git+https://github.com/MameMame777/LocalLLM.git` due to setup.py issues, making external project integration difficult.

### 🔍 Error Details
```bash
× Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully.
│ exit code: 1
╰─> subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'venv\Scripts\pip install --upgrade pip' returned non-zero exit status 1
```

### 🎯 Root Cause Analysis
1. **setup.py creates virtual environment during installation**
   - This conflicts with pip's build process
   - Causes subprocess errors during wheel building

2. **Project designed as standalone application**
   - Not structured for external package integration
   - Missing proper Python package structure

3. **Complex dependency management**
   - setup.py tries to manage its own environment
   - Conflicts with existing Python environments

### 💡 Suggested Solutions

#### Option 1: Create Proper Package Structure
- Add proper `__init__.py` files to make modules importable
- Remove environment creation from setup.py
- Simplify dependency management
- Add package entry points

#### Option 2: Provide Integration Documentation
- Document how to integrate LocalLLM as a submodule
- Provide path-based integration examples
- Create external integration guide

#### Option 3: Create Separate Package
- Split core functionality into installable package
- Keep standalone application separate
- Provide both options for users

### 🔧 Workaround Currently Used
```python
# Add LocalLLM path to sys.path for integration
import sys
from pathlib import Path
localllm_path = Path("../LocalLLM")
sys.path.insert(0, str(localllm_path))
from src.api.enhanced_api import summarize_json
```

### 📝 Use Case
We're trying to integrate LocalLLM's summarization functionality into our InfoGetter project for FPGA document analysis. The goal is to use LocalLLM's excellent Japanese translation and summarization capabilities.

### 🌟 Expected Behavior
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/MameMame777/LocalLLM.git
# Should work without errors
```

```python
# Should be importable after installation
from localllm.api.enhanced_api import summarize_json
```

### 📊 Environment
- Python: 3.10+
- OS: Windows 11
- pip: 25.2

### 🙏 Request
Could you please consider making LocalLLM installable as a proper Python package for external project integration?

**Thank you for the excellent work on LocalLLM! The functionality is impressive, and we'd love to integrate it properly into our project.**
